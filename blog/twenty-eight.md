# Twenty-eight

I had the great fortune to be a co-author on an [e-book](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/guidance/fusion-dev-ebook/) for Microsoft. The book looks at how developers can use the Power Platform alongside business users to quickly create Apps that meet real business needs. 

<!--truncate-->

I wrote the chapter on creating a [low-code prototype](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/guidance/fusion-dev-ebook/03-building-low-code-prototype). 

Why am I writing about it here? Well, I've written 100's of micro-learning modules, but none of them show who the authors are. The e-book is different, my name is there in the author list. 

Now, on my CV and LinkedIn profile, I can point people to a webpage where I'm credited as an author. I hope this might give me a leg up on other technical authors in my job search.
