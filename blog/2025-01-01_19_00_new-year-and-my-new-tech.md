# New Year and my new tech
<!-- truncate -->

I’ll start with the cool computer that could fit in my pocket, and that is my Ubuntu machine for testing. 

The [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), with an NVMe M.2 HAT+ and 512GB drive. 

I installed Ubuntu 24.10 - but I’m currently failing to get my new MacBook Pro M4 to RDP to it. I’d like to run the Pi headless so I can just use it daily from my Mac. 

I upgraded from a M1 MacBook Air and haven’t been as impressed with the speed bump as I thought I would be… the M1 was that good. 

My tech fail has been Tado. I added four smart radiators - and they can’t all connect to the central Tado connector. The fix from Tado is to spend another £250 to upgrade to the newer version. I’m thinking I’m going to change to Drayton. 

I will write the new post about getting work done on my MacBook M4 Pro.
