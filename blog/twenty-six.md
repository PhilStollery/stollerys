# Twenty-six

My Mum's been taken to hospital. She's got a severe case of diarrhoea and was dangerously dehydrated. The problem is: I'm four hours away by car and don't think being there can help her.

Her spirits are up, and she was cracking jokes about the world falling out of her ass. I know today she'll be low because this is when the steroids stop helping her feel better from the chemo. 

She's in the best place, but I'm obviously worrying. She heard a doctor or nurse mention acidosis, which in the end was how my dad died. His system was shutting down and couldn't regulate his Ph levels. 

Send some good wishes her way, for the poo to stop and a safe return home.
