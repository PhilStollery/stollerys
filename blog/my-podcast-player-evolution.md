# My Podcast Player Evolution

<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-clock" /> UPDATED: Wednesday, 29 August 2025

My evolution:

<!-- truncate -->

- Started with: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) (subscriber)
- Then: [Castro](https://www.castro.fm) (subscriber)
- Settled: [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com) (paid for online and iOS)
- *Back on: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) (still a subscriber)
- **Back on: [Castro](https://www.castro.fm) (still a subscriber)

Pocket Casts enables me to listen on my PC, Mac, iPhone, and Sonos speakers easily. Still <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-heart" /> Overcast though [Marco](https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment).

*I was having strange battery issues, and Overcast is going to get some SwiftUI updates soon, I think.
