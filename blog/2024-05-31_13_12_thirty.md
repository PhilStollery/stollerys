# Thirty

Wow. What a ride. I missed one day due to, er, writing a technical test for a job application. I sincerely hope I get it, as it sounds like a perfect fit.

On this last post day, I have spent some time fixing the old posts. I forgot to tag all these posts properly. I've also realised that by not giving a proper title to each post, I can't find posts. I also updated posts with a P.S. (**I love that that's my brand**) where things have moved on. I had also miss numbered my posts, thinking I should be keeping it to the dates.

This has prompted an exploration on how to implement [search](/search), I'll be trying out [Algolia](https://ramono.me/blog/implementing-algolia-on-static-site/) â€” but adding good tags will help in the short term. 

I think [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) has inspired me to blog more, and enabled a voice I didn't know I had and that I'd like to continue to share. 

Keep weblogging.
