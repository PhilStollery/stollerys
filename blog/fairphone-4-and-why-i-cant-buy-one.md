The thing is, I've been addicted since iPhone 4. All in, bought a MacBook, so I've spent thousands of pounds with Apple.

I have got my wife and daughter in on it too. They love their phones too.

But, I like freedom. 

I've got tech chops, in my day job I have to work on Windows. I bought a cute Android phone. I could switch. The new Fairphone 4 looks great. I could even go non-google. 

But. 

Everything else is Apple. My wife, daughter, laptop, iPad, TV and services. Find my is great. Messages is great. FaceTime is used all the time. 

If you've not become addicted, look at the [Fairphone](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/buy-fairphone-4#tech-specs). It does look great.
