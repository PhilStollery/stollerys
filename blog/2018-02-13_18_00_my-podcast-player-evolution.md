# My Podcast Player Evolution
<!-- truncate -->

<aside class="post-info"><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> UPDATED: Wednesday, 5 July 2023</aside>

My evolution:

- Started with: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) (subscriber)
- Then: [Castro](https://www.castro.fm) (subscriber)
- Settled: [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com) (paid for online and iOS)
- *Back on: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) (subscriber)

Pocket Casts enables me to listen on my PC, Mac, iPhone, and Sonos speakers easily. Still <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i> Overcast though [Marco](https://mastodon.social/@marcoarment).

*I was having strange battery issues, and Overcast is going to get some SwiftUI updates soon, I think.
