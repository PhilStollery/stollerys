I have a problem. All the work I've done for Microsoft isn't attributed. I have the source Markdown in my forks of the Learn repo (which I'll lose access to when I leave my current job). But all the work is under embargo and no author names are included on published modules. So people and companies have to trust me when I link to the modules that I've written. 

When I'm being asked for writing samples, these problems make it difficult for me. I'm not sure if I should link to this blog. As it doesn't reflect the technical writing I do. It's more of a public diary of thoughts and feelings.

Well, I have a second round interview â€” so I guess we'll see if what I submit is enough. Wish me luck.
