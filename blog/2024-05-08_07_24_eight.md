# Eight

I'm trying something different today. Writing into the iOS LanguageTool app. It doesn't officially support Markdown â€” but that's the great thing about Markdown. It's just plain text, so it is supported.

Today I'll share my coffee making tools. I've been a fan of [AeroPress](https://www.aeropress.co.uk/) for years. 

![Step one. A photograph of a kitchen counter top. There's a Yeti cup, topped with an AeroPress, and then a circular plastic container filled with whole coffee beans. Next to it is a jar of whole coffee beans and a spoon.](https://cdn.some.pics/phils/663b29efae8f3.jpg)

I then tried ground coffee from the supermarket, coffee subscriptions, and currently I get [whole beans in the post](https://exhalecoffee.com/). The cool trick I have to share with you is my battery powered [burr grinder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BKPML8YS). 

![Step two. Showing a coffee cup, AeroPress now topped with an electric burr grinder. It's grinding the whole beans because there's a blue ring shinning on top. ](https://cdn.some.pics/phils/663b2aaaa09ce.jpg)

It just sits perfectly on top of the AeroPress, hit the button, and boom freshly ground coffee straight into my [massive cup](https://uk.yeti.com/collections/tumbler/products/rambler-20-oz-tumbler).
