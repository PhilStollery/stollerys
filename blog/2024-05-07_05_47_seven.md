# Seven
<!-- truncate -->

What a great [movie](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/). Although I guess some people won't watch it now, as the bad guy really is a [bad guy](https://www.thecut.com/article/all-of-the-allegations-against-actor-kevin-spacey.html).

This post makes it a seven-day streak. But this post is really a placeholder. I've got back from Yorkshire and visiting my Mum. Wait, I can share my posting process — like I've seen other people do. 

Well, I'm lazy. I started out on the omg.lol portal, then linked it to GitHub, as I thought I'd use that to update my weblog. Now I'm back on omg.lol — because it's easier. I can post from my phone on the loo, I can post on my Mac, Ubuntu VM, or work PC. 

I've also moved to Firefox everywhere. I'd been browsing for a new Browser, Edge, Arc, Safari, and back to Firefox. Mainly because of Ubuntu, and Arc upsetting me. 

I start all my posts with these settings:

```yaml

Status: Draft

```

Write using [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/), save, check the draft, then delete the `Status: Draft` line. I wait for [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app/) to do its job, then edit the post to have a [Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Friends_episodes) episode style summary. 

Questions?
