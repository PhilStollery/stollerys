# Finishing what you start

My move to using the same blogging platform as I do my day-to-day work on, hopefully means I will blog more. This little post is about finishing moving all the other things tagged onto this domain.

So what do I have?

- [david.stollerys.co.uk](https://david.stollerys.co.uk): Hosting my Dad's eulogy website - currently pushing to Netlify but will move to Cloudflare Workers as soon as I can.
- [me.stollerys.co.uk](https://me.stollerys.co.uk): Pointing to omg.lol for a simple about me page.
- [now.stollerys.co.uk](https://now.stollerys.co.uk): Pointing to omg.lol for what's happening for me right now.
- [photos.stollerys.co.uk](https://photos.stollerys.co.uk): Used to point to SmugMug when we were sharing family photos. No longer used.
- [status.stollerys.co.uk](https://status.stollerys.co.uk): Pointing to omg.lol for status.lol posts. 

Can you see something missing that I should have done months ago - but just didn't? Well I spent a few hours adding a new stollerys.co.uk website.

- [ann.stollerys.co.uk](https://ann.stollerys.co.uk): Hosting my Mum's eulogy website.

A repurposed version of the website I spent far too much time on when my Dad died. I think it was a way to keep busy, using the skills I have. Instead of spending the really important time to grieve. This time I think I did a much better job spending the time I needed with my Mum and family - instead of on a computer.
