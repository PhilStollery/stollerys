Employee surveys. Large companies think that, "Listening to their employees", is important. The problem is that sometimes what an employee's saying isn't something they want to hear — or really address.

I've just completed an anonymous employee survey with very brutally honest answers. Like telling them I've leaving and looking for a new role somewhere else. The main reason because I can see no future for me with them.

What can they do with that feedback? They can't change my mind. They won't listen to my suggestions for improvement because they can write it off as a disgruntled employee. However, the issues I see will continue, and more people will follow my footsteps.

People who suck up and say everything is rosy don't help either — as they will lead to zero change. So I reiterate, what's the point of employee surveys?
