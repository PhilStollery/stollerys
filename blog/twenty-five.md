# Twenty-five

I missed my first day in [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) yesterday. It was a Saturday, so I can't blame a busy workday. I obviously have a reason. But I want to sit with the feeling of failure.

I was enjoying posting every day. It did feel like an achievement. Making up the funny little Mastodon posts summing up each post is fun. 

Does missing one day in the month make the whole series now pointless? No, each post on its own has value. The posts capture a thought or something that I felt like sharing. The nudge from [Annie](https://social.lol/@anniegreens) to try it every day really worked on me. 

Is being perfect something worth aiming for? I like to be *right*. I will enjoy arguing when I think I'm right. Missing a day feels like I got something wrong, which does sit badly with me in my gut. However, I've started saying to people in my life who are beating themselves up, "Try to be kind to yourself". Being kind, like in [Hamilton](https://stollerys.co.uk/2024/05/nineteen), is forgiveness. Probably why the Catholic Church has made so much money — confess my son, and you shall be forgiven. 

So on to another day and another post.
