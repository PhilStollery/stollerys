# Twenty-two
<!-- truncate -->


We've been having some unseasonal sunshine here in the UK. Today we got back to more of what I'm used to. Nice warm consistent drizzle. 
I've got better at not plugging in before I set off dog walking. Today's interesting side effect of walking bare foot and bare ear was that I noticed smells more. It's as if listening to someone speak (on a podcast) causes you to focus solely on that. Your other senses and mind are pushed to the background. 

The smells I noticed were a wet wooden fence, flowers, rubbish, and a strong smell of weed.

I'm still progressing with 2 of 3 jobs. The one that I was unsuccessful with I might mention later. Or just post about it on the [don](https://social.lol/@phils).
