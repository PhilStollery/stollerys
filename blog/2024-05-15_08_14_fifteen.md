Wish me luck â€” two interviews today. I've also already failed at my no podcasts when I walk my dogs thing from yesterday. Damn you [ATP Neutral](https://social.lol/deck/@atpfm@mastodon.social/112441307584659383). I did manage to realise about a third of the way through the walk and got back to nothingness. I am starting to notice some benefits, probably matching those found in Japan while [bathing](https://www.japan.travel/en/guide/forest-bathing/).

Back to interview prep.
