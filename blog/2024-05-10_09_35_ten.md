I found a solution to yesterday's problem. With the help of Firefox and the [Print Edit WE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/print-edit-we/) extension, I created a PDF for each page of the Microsoft module. So for some courses this is 7 PDFs. I then used the free (but you have to register as a user) Adobe website to [merge](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/acrobat/combine-pdf) them into a single document. 

I've built the best into a clean PDF, you can read it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-0BNVNgXw4JusPJDaTp8Vp4jHFFECcL/view?usp=sharing).

P.S. You can now find all my writing samples at [/writings](/writings).
