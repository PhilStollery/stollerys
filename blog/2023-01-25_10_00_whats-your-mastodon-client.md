# What’s your Mastodon client?

I’m a newbie on Mastodon. Part of the great migration. On space Karen’s plaything I was mainly a consumer. I just consumed and didn’t post much.

I’m not sure if it’s a new year thing, or a shiny effect, but I’m tooting more and more. But how to toot. Here’s what I’ve tried, listed in order of preference:

1. Ivory - yep it's good [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-right" />](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274)
1. Ice Cubes [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-right" />](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884)
1. Mammoth [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-right" />](https://testflight.apple.com/join/66c1wW8y)*
1. Elk [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-right" />](https://elk.zone) 
1. Default web app [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-right" />](https://social.lol/@phils)
1. Tusker [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-right" />](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tusker/id1498334597)

\* TestFlight links are full 😭

Yep 🐘 has jumped up to my number one after it released on the iOS app store.

[PS Update: I'm now using [trunks](https://trunks.social/features) - a markdown supporting client!]
