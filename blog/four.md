# Four

I’m away from my computer at the moment. Travelled to see my Mum for her birthday. It’s now going to be bitter-sweet every year for her and us. Because last year my [Dad](https://david.stollerys.co.uk) died on the same day.

So the next three posts are going to be shorter, and might have a few more typos. 

The strange thing is I got an email from [Clicks](https://www.clicks.tech/), notifying me that it’s now available for the plain iPhone 15. In a rather fetching blue colour. I managed to resist, but if my work plans pan out, this might be my new job gift to myself. Along with a new [solar-powered watch](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/679335).
