Tech support time. If you've read my introduction post, you'll have seen I love all things Apple. In the past I've needed a Thunderbolt dock and according to [Casey Liss](https://mastodon.social/@caseyliss) the [CalDigit TS3 Plus](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/) was the best in class. I think I bought this when I had an Intel MacBook Pro. The dock charged and drove my 4K monitor perfectly. However, there was a weird mouse and keyboard issue. The mouse stuttered. Letters kept being dropped. I never fixed it. The dock went into storage (the top draw of the desk cabinet).

Now that I'm looking for a new job, I've realised I'll need to return the excellent [HP thunderbolt dock 120W G4](https://www.hp.com/gb-en/shop/product.aspx?id=4j0a2aa&opt=abu&sel=acc) if I leave. The HP dock never had the mouse problem and powered my HP ZBook and new MacBook Air perfectly. 

I decided to break out the CalDigit to see if the mouse issue still existed. Argh, it was still broke. This time I decided to use my great Kagi search, it found both a Reddit and CalDigit support article and there's a fix.

![What a great-looking solution. This is a picture of a CalDigit dock connected to an ugly USB extension cable connected to a Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse dongle. There is also a keyboard and mouse in the picture.](http://caldigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/KB-JE-20.jpg)

I don't know if this will fix it, but I'll find out tomorrow.
