It's my weekend, and I've fallen off the wagon. I walked the dogs to [Lovett or Leave It](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/lovett-or-leave-it/) and the [Flop House](https://www.flophousepodcast.com/). It showed me just how much less attention I have when I'm plugged in. I keep on walking past the dogs, whereas when my ears are enjoying nothingness, I follow the dogs. 

Other benefits are that my mind does wander. I think — and those thoughts take me to interesting places. It's a question that fills me with terror, "What are you thinking?". This is because my default state was podcasts in my ears — and therefore someone else's thoughts were in my head. My honest answer was always nothing.

When I'm not walking the dogs, I'm trying to have podcasts playing on my iPhone like a radio. This lets the audio live in the background.

Follow up on my CalDigit issue. I have the USB extension cable, and … I believe it is now fixed. I need a few more days of typing and mousing to conclusively prove it, though.
