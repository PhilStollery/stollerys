# Twenty-four
<!-- truncate -->

This is the latest in the day that I've posted for [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024). I've fallen off the dog walking with bare ears for the last two days. [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected) yesterday and [ATP](https://atp.fm/587) today. I really wanted to hear what the boys had to say about [Copilot+PCs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-laptop-7th-edition/8tq2hq5xxkj9/0dgw).

I had a topic in my head while I was having my breakfast. What was it, I was doing my coffee? Er, ah, got it! I experienced customer retention where I didn't expect it.

I assume most people have had calls with Mobile operators, or broadband providers. You say I'd like to leave, they say I'll give you some money off, you say ok I'll stay. 

Well, I had this conversation virtually with the cancellation of my coffee subscription. I said, yep I'd like to cancel, they had a form where I could give a reason. I said too expensive, but love the coffee. They said, how about £4 off for the next three months. I bit their hand off. 

I wonder what the offers going to be in 3 months? Can a company have real-time metrics on the cost of customer acquisition — and simply offer you that amount off your bill to keep you? I'll let you know in 3 months.
