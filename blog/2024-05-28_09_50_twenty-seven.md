# Twenty-seven

I've had the chance to write in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/) in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) IDEA. I was impressed by IntelliJ's onboarding experience. After installing the app, you can choose to go through a guided tour of the UI. The [AsciiDoctor](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc) plugin was great as well, providing syntax help and exporting the docs as a PDF.

My day job is all Markdown, and my wonderful weblog, but I can definitely see the advantages of AsciiDoc.

Here's to learning new stuff.

![DALL-E image created from this prompt. Can you create an image of two cartoon characters. One represnets Markdown and the other AsciiDocs, they're friends. Maybe holding hands? Two cute characters are holding hands, one with a HTML like doc in front of them, the other has an M on their chest. A love heart is between them.](https://cdn.some.pics/phils/6655c643a7e5e.jpg)
