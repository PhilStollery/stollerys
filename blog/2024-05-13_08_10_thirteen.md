# Thirteen
<!-- truncate -->

Is the age of my daughter. She is growing up into a very self-confident person. When I remind her of this, she gives me the credit. I am confident in many things, and like to challenge myself.

However, and I'd never tell her this, being a good parent isn't one of them. I try to help her when she asks for it. I try to show her, and my wife, that I love them. I try to be patient when she's struggling. I try to make her laugh. Basically, I'm trying my best â€” hoping it will be enough. 

This whole [#WeblogPoMo2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) has forced me to write when some days I really don't feel like it. That's the problem for me, feeling something.

I have a big announcement on this in tomorrows post.
