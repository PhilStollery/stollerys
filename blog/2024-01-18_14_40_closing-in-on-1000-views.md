Thank you, if youâ€™ve come to check out my web musings. Being part of the new indie web renaissance must be part of it, or maybe Mastodon is just a better place for my social posts. These have then driven traffic my way.

If you donâ€™t have a blog, or a Mastodon instance, have a look at [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/phils). The little heart has encouraged me to put more out there.

If you need some help:

* [IndieWeb.org](https://indieweb.org/) â€” A wiki that explains the principles and practices of the indie web, and provides tutorials and tools for creating your own website.
* [JoinMastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org/) â€” The home of Mastodon.
* [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/phils) â€” A platform that lets you create your own personal website with a custom domain, a bio, a blog, and a now page.
