# Hi 

I realised my [about](https://me.stollerys.co.uk) link in my navigation should just be my omg.lol page. Therefore, I wanted a longer intro post, like the ones I've seen on Mastodon.

I have to blame my parents for my love of tech. They bought my brother and I an [Amstrad CPC 464](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464). I think I was maybe 8. They typed in programmes from magazines. I loved it. In my mind, I said to myself, "I want to earn money using one of these. All the time. I want to _do_ computers". As I grew older I added a [Sega Master System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System), [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1200), and then IBM PCs. 

My school let me down, no GCSE in computing. The closest I got to IT was a class called business studies, which equalled Excel. However, I knew I could study Computer Science at University. So I aimed my A Levels at getting enough points and relevance to get in.  

Since Uni, I’ve been working with Microsoft Technologies, from Visual Basic, C++, .NET, Access, SharePoint, and SQL Server databases. I've always loved the web but didn't go that path. I got paid for IT in big business. 

So I've designed, implemented, and managed OLTP, data warehousing, and OLAP data systems. During these projects, I was able to flex multiple disciplines. From database design, ETL, Power BI, and reporting.

Now I get paid to focus on creating technical content to help other developers get up-to-speed. Recent projects include writing instructor-led content for courses focused on SQL Server, both on-premises and in Azure. It has enabled me to visit the head office of Microsoft in Seattle to help shape their job role description of a SQL Admin. I was also fortunate enough to be a co-author on a [Power Platform eBook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/guidance/fusion-dev-ebook/). 

I wanted to put my knowledge sharing skills to the test, and really believe there should be more diversity within tech. So I spent 8 weeks [teaching girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) about SQL using PostgreSQL. 

My personal tech life is very different. All Apple, from my iPhone to the MacBook Air. I have no free ear time, they are filled with [podcasts](https://phils.omg.lol/now) if I’m not talking to my family or watching TV.
