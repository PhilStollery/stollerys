Hamilton Live. I'm lucky enough to live near Bristol and could afford to get tickets to see Hamilton at the [Hippodrome](https://www.atgtickets.com/venues/bristol-hippodrome/). I'd heard lots about it on my podcasts. Then watched it as soon as it was available on Disney+. Not only that, I also devoured the official cast recording.

However, I've not listened to it for a few years and had forgotten some of its intricacies. It didn't fail to make my cry â€” always when Eliza holds Hamilton's hand. **Forgiveness**. 

Standing ovation and lots of clapping. The show was brilliant.

P.S. If you were paying attention, you'll have noticed I didn't post this in time. I did have it sat in my LanguageTool draft, just forgot to post it on omg.lol!
