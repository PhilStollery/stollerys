# I've spent my whole working life on Windows
<!-- truncate -->

I've had 3 full days working at a new company where I can use my personal Mac to do my day job. I never realised how _heavy_ Windows felt until now. 

I'm going to give it some time, and come back and P.S. this post with my thoughts after a month. But at the moment, I feel like I'm flying on my Mac.
