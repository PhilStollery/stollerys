# I made a website that I didn’t want to make

My Dad, David Stollery, passed away on the 6th of May. He wrote his own order of service and recorded his eulogy. But he didn’t make a website. I did that while being with my Mum for the first week after he passed.

If you want to learn more about him, see the [website](https://david.stollerys.co.uk) I made.

I think I did this to keep me busy, and I thought he’d like it. It was also a place we could put his eulogy for anyone to hear — like those who couldn’t attend the funeral.

[PS: It's been a year since his death, and I was really touched to find out my daughter uses the website to listen to her Grandads voice. That made making the website worth it.]
