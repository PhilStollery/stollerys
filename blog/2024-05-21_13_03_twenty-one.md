# Twenty-one

I've just finished Fallout. Not the game, the TV series. In fact, being on a Mac and not having a PlayStation or Xbox means I can't have played the game. If they released a Switch version, maybe.

I'm not against ultra violence in my media, but something irked me about their use of it. Heads being squashed and hacked off, fingers being peeled and cut off. It was a bit too much and wasn't really needed for the story. And it was the story that propelled me on to finish the series. Because of the strength of the story, I'll also probably watch the next series if they get to make it. 

A good example of where violence didn't bother me is Sh≈çgun. Please watch it, it's amazing.

Back to X-Men '97 for me. I'm really enjoying that too.
