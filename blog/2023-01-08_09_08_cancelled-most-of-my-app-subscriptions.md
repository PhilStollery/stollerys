# Cancelled most of my app subscriptions

Looking at my monthly outgoings I realised I could start making savings. Hereâ€™s the list of subs I cancelled.

<!-- truncate -->

- AirMail pro (trying default Mail app)
- Backone app (the device still works)
- CARROT weather (trying default Weather App)
- Darkroom (I can edit if I need to on my Mac)
- Halide Mark II (I find I donâ€™t use it using default app)
- Hullomail (will use the default I donâ€™t get visual voicemail with my service provider)
- Paste - Clipboard Manager (Never think or use it on my phone)
- Pixel Pals (Loved it but is just whimsy I can live without)
- Tweetbot (Bye Twitter will pay for Ivory maybe)
- Twitterrific (Too much Twitter)
- Typewise custom keyboard (Loved it but going back to default keyboard. Did have a few of glitches - especially around auto complete from txt)
- Widgetsmith (I ended up only using one or two in the end)

I wonâ€™t list what Iâ€™m keeping - but they are things I feel are worth paying for. 

Happy New Year ðŸ¥³
