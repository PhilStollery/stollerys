My Mum has recently been diagnosed with cancer. Not lethal, but she does need chemotherapy. <!-- truncate -->She knitted herself some hats for when her hair falls out. Yesterday, she sent me a picture wearing one. Then I watched this. I didn't cry. I'm not sure how I managed that.

Thank you [Edith Zimmerman](https://kottke.org/24/02/visible-mending-on-love-death-and-knitting), for finding it.
