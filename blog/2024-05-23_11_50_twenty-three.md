# Twenty-three

Procrastination. I make fun of my Wife and Daughter when they procrastinate on doing something. I call them the ‘pro-cras-ti-nator’ and do a little robot dance. 

I've read things online that say that it's about a fear of failure, or lack of immediate threat. I'm struggling with a little myself today, and it's around having too many options. I just don't know where to start. The advice I'd give my Wife would be just pick one. It doesn't matter which you choose — just let it unblock you. Once you've started, hopefully you'll get a momentum going and be able to roll onto the next thing. 

It's good advice I think, so I need to go do something.
