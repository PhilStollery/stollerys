# Microsoft Learn author

Unfortunately, due to NDA and other fun things, I can't talk about how all the modules on microsoft.com/learn are made. The other problem is that each module doesn't include any author information.

What I'm listing here are modules that I have a personal interest in <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-smile-wink" />.

- Protect your virtual machines with Azure Backup [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-link" />](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/protect-virtual-machines-with-azure-backup)
- Protect your on-premises infrastructure from disasters with Azure Site Recovery [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-link" />](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/protect-on-premises-infrastructure-with-azure-site-recovery/)
- Choose the appropriate API for Azure Cosmos DB storage [<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-link" />](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/choose-api-for-cosmos-db)
- More to come at [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse)
