# It's been a long time

Before I explain my move, first some thanks. Thank you to [Neatnik](https://neatnik.net) and [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) for hosting my blog for the last 3 years. It was [weblog.lol](https://weblog.lol) that triggered me to write and share my thoughts again.

I've not blogged for months. I've been busy with work, but one of the real reasons is that my Mum finally lost her battle with cancer in June. She fought till the end, and my brother was with her while I was down the road having a Sunday Lunch for Fathers Day. 

Work is still busy, but this weekend my Wife and daughter are away, so I've been looking at how my blog works - and it wasn't for me.

I'm a technical writer, and I've been leading on my current contract with the approach to how we'll do technical documentation. We started with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) but more recently moved to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). I'm loving the node ecosystem, and with native blogging support decided to migrate my blog to Docusaurus.

This is it, and I'm pleased with how it looks out of the box. I'm going to do some styling, but I like the author, tags, and the ability to add custom pages. So everything has moved over to here.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
