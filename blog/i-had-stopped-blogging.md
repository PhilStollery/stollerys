# I had stopped blogging

I think two things happened. I wasn’t busy/dedicated to my work, and I was looking for a new job. 

<!--truncate-->

Then #WeblogPoMo2024 was a kick in the arse I needed to try and write on the web every day. So I did, almost everyday for a whole month. 

The trigger for me stopping - a new job that I’m loving and very busy with. 

It was also the tooling. I’d setup a GitHub CI/CD pipeline but didn’t have a dedicated tool on my iPhone to write with. 

So, with a two week holiday, and a fresh subscription to [working copy](https://workingcopy.app/) on my phone I’m writing this on Boxing Day. 

Now I’m not promising a post every day - but I am promising to write about working on my Mac for the last 4 months and the takeaways.
