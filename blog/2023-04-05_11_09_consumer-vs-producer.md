# Consumer vs Producer

I've realised, and knew really, that I'm not a blogger. I don't have things I need to post on the web. I don't need to share my thoughts. In fact, I'm reverting to my original Twitter behaviour. I consume rather than produce. 

<!-- truncate -->

I'm more than happy to reply to posts, toots, tweets, with witty comebacks. I'm happy to question someone's logic when I don't get it. But original thoughts seem to be illusive to me. 

So this blog will be as I state on the home page. A collection of things I find on the web. A place to post occasionally when I do want to share. Somewhere where that I own the content. 

For everyone else. Please keep producing, as I love consuming it.
